User must keep the logo.png and way_of_life.py in the same folder.
This is necessary for the game to display the custom logo correctly.

The game uses CustomTkinter and Tkinter.
Tkinter comes pre-installed with Python, so no installation needed.
CustomTkinter needs to be installed manually.
Install CustomTkinter via pip:
pip install customtkinter
