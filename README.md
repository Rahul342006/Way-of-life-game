Way-of-life-game
A text-based game that explores life decisions and outcomes  built in Python

Problem Statement:
Misunderstandings about identity and roles in our culture often create social divisions, as many people still misinterpret cultural identity as something fixed by birth rather than by values and way of life

We’re creating a mini text-based “life simulation game” (like a simplified BitLife) in Python. In the game, a character starts at a young age (say 10 years old) and faces different life events as they grow older. At each stage, the player makes choices. The outcomes show how knowledge, skills, and actions (not birth) used to define roles in society (like scholar, warrior, etc.) in earlier times.

Features:
-Interactive, text-based decision-making gameplay.
-Multiple life paths and outcomes based on choices.
-Tracks player stats.
-Replayable with different strategies to explore outcomes.

Tech Stack:
What I have used:
-Language: Python
-Libraries / Tools: Tkinter, Custom Tkinter.

Future Plans:
-Add more dynamic life events. Currently, the program has only five events.
-Make the game more engaging and interactive, similar to BitLife.
-Introduce branching paths and randomized outcomes for replayability.
